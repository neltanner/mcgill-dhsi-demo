[Dramatic male speaking voice]:

As an army terrible with batters sweeping before it the black shades of night, routing despair, comes the flaming truth of the God law.

Why do you suffer the indignities of life, when you can control life? Your fate is in your hands now, for at last, the way is open, if you will but take it. 
When Dr. Frank B Robinson first realized the dynamic implications of Psychiana, he was in debt, a humble drug clerk with no future, no hope. Now he possesses all that he wants of wealth, his mind is at peace, and he is accorded praise and renown as an outstanding and famous psychologist. The same forces that raised him out of the depths, to stand on a high plane among men, can be put to work for you."

Located at the hub of campus pedestrian movement, the U-shaped design channels circulation through the building and creates a meeting place that is integral to the busy central campus green.
A hard edge of existing buildings that border on the site contrasts with the more organic, informal Union, a building of “glass and grass” that emerges from the green as a three-dimensional park. A continuous network of stairs, landings, and entrances constitutes the building’s exterior, and with additional interior stairs and elevators, this extensive circulation allows thousands of students to access the many facilities throughout the day and night. The structure is one interlocking system comprised of various-sized hexagonal modules with sloping faces, which are glazed and landscaped. The sloping modules connect through a system of hinging and pivoting walls, which permits flexibility for interior spaces. The distinct precast concrete modules could be mass-produced and easily assembled on-site. Modules combine to form spaces of various sizes and qualities of light without sacrificing fast and cost-efficient construction.
Initiated and approved by the students, the design’s rejection by the College Board of Trustees in 1968 incited campus riots.",College buildings,"San Francisco, California",37.7225174,122.4977802,Moshe Safdie Collection,cac_sfsc_student_union,Image;StillImage,application/pdf,eng,"In Copyright.
