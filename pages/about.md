## About the Industrial Architecture of Montreal Site

This demo collection is a DHSI 2024 project.

For almost a century Montreal was the industrial centre of Canada. Between 1847-1945, the area surrounding the Lachine Canal had the highest concentration of industrial buildings in the country. The variety of buildings included factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries which today provide a legacy of historic and architectural interest. Presently, plans are in development to remodel and transform the industrial districts of Montreal, particularly in the location of the Lachine Canal. Industrial Architecture of Montreal aims to collect, organize, and preserve textual and visual information on approximately 130 industrial buildings, before their transformations, and make this information available via a searchable database on the Web. Other organizations in cities in England and the United States have constructed websites aimed at providing information and promoting their industrial architectural heritage; nothing comparable exists presently in Canada. This index provides a unique index for the study of Montreal's architectural history.

## Historical Overview: The Lachine Canal and Montrealâ€™s Industrial Heritage

The building of the Lachine Canal, a waterway connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean, was a significant event in the history of Montreal. The Canal literally changed the appearance and texture of the city, attracting industrial interests and both immigrants and the rural population of Quebec. The idea of constructing a canal originated in the earliest days of New France. The St. Lawrence River was the main artery of communication and transportation and in 1689, Francois Dollier de Casson, the Superior of the Sulpicians, who at the time owned the island of Montreal, planned and financed a canal which was to be two kilometres long. However, work on the canal ceased after only two months due to the discovery of a large body of rock in the path of construction and a surprise attack made by the Iroquois. Dollier de Casson made a second attempt in 1700 but upon his death a year later, work was again abandoned.
